## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to develope a complate landing page to fit each part in the place it should be.

### Continued development

For pages of this sizes or bigger, I think I'll need use tools like SASS or Bootstrap to keep the styles in order.
