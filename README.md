## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to develope a complate landing page, with importance on semantic HTML, pure CSS and a piece of JavaScript where was required.

### Continued development

For pages of this sizes or bigger, I think I'll need use tools like SASS or Bootstrap to keep the styles in order.
